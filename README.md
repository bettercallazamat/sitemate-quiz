Your challenge is to create a reusable confirmation dialog component by using vanilla javascript, html and css within 2 hours. 

This component should be able to accept a confirmation message as a parameter from the main page (the consumer of your component) and shouldnâ€™t know anything else from the consumer.

If the user clicks either Yes or No button, the component should return the result to the consumer so the consumer can act accordingly.
